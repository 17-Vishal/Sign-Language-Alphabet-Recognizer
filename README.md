# Sign-Language-Alphabet-Recognizer

README File

In this project we will use image processing and gesture recognition to detect and analyse hand signs and convert it to text alphabets.
We’ll be using python ,openCV, and tensorflow to train a neutral network model.
The project will contain a dataset.

In this project we will be making a dataset with different hand sign images of all alphabets, space symbol, delete symbol and nothing symbol.
The model will detect and process the video from webcam in real time and convert the signs to alphabets and show them on the screen. 
We will be training inception V3 architecture model.
